PhoneGap Build Config.xml Generator ColdFusion Builder extension
============

A very long name for something that makes your life just that little bit easier.


Installation
----------------

Download the extension as a .zip file and install via the Extensions view in ColdFusion Builder.


Use
----------------

This is a ColdFusion Builder IDE extension to help you create and amend Config.xml files for use with the PhoneGap Build service.

This extension adds a new menu item to the project view context menu:

PhoneGap Build > Generate Config.xml

Selecting this option on a folder in that view will open the generation wizard. The Config.xml file will be created and saved in the selected folder.

If the wizard detects an existing Config.xml file in that location, it will give you the opportunity to load that file so that you can amend it.
